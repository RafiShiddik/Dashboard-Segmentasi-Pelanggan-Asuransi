# Customer Segmentation & CLTV Prediction Dashboard with Streamlit
This project looks at the LTV value for each customer.

# information about the data set
This data set comes from the state insurance company of india

# features in this project 
- BG/NBD (Beta Geo) for transaction number prediction
- Gamma-Gamma for transaction value estimation
- Combination of manual RFM segmentation, KMeans clustering, and comparison visualization between methods
- Displayed via an interactive Streamlit-based dashboard

# Insight
- Based on their lifetime, customers are divided into four categories: loyal, single-payer, stable, and inactive.
- The customers with the highest revenue for the company are in cluster 2 because they frequently purchase, even though it's an insurance company.

# strategies and recommendations
- Offer loyalty programs and upsells to cluster 2, as this group is the most active.
- Provide comeback vouchers or targeted promotions to increase engagement for cluster 3.
- Re-evaluate: perhaps these high-value but dormant customers need a dedicated campaign or consider a small reactivation test.
